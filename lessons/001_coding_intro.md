## Who are we?
- I'm Will and he's Orlin
- I'm orli and he's wil
- We both have lots of programming experience and would love to share it with you
- Plug: we're working on a new app called Flyboat, it's a drop-in replacement for Talos since Talos sucks. When we're done please help us by begging the school to switch to Flyboat!

---

## Attendance and logistics
- We will create a website where you can log in with your Discord account to track your attendance.
- Each lesson will have a different link so you can't cheat and use the same link for multiple lessons :wink:
- We will post slides on our slides website, https://fbla-lessons.thdr.me

---

## Attendance and logistics (cont.)
- The person/people who attend the most lessons may or may not get a prize/commendation at the end of the year
- We will be using Discord for off-hours Q&A and to post announcements. **Pay attention there!**
- **Don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand something!**

---

## What is programming?
- Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to execute. This is very broad, but it'll serve as a basic definition before we get into the nitty-gritty.
- Programming isn't just writing the code. It's also debugging (ü§Æ), testing (üßë‚Äçüè´), and documenting (ü§ì).
- Anyone can learn how to program, but it takes **practice** and **patience** to become good at it.

---

## What is programming? (cont.)
- There are virtually infinite programming languages (you can even create your own), but we will be using Node.js and JavaScript for this course (because it is quite web-centric, which modern business is about).
- Don't worry if you don't understand everything. We will be going over everything in detail.

---

## Why is it useful in business?
- You can automate boring tasks and save your precious time for more important things, like Valorant, Genshin Impact, and Among Us.
- You can create websites and applications to build your web presence and make your business more accessible.
- You can do data analysis and create visualizations to make better business decisions.

---

## Why is it useful in business? (cont.)
- You can carry out monetary transactions and manage your finances instantly instead of going to the bank, opening a wire transfer, and waiting for it to go through.
- Computers are cool

---

## Environment Setup
- We will be using Replit, an online IDE (integrated development environment) that allows you to write code, run it, and debug it all in one place.
- Please go to https://replit.com and create an account. You can either link your Google account or create a new account with an email and password.

## Environment Setup (cont.)
- Once you have an account, go to https://thdr.me/fbla-replit. You will be added to our team!
- The QR code does the same thing as the link.
- We will assign homework and demos here, so make sure you check it regularly.

## Q&A
- Questions?
- Comments?
- Concerns?
- Rants about how you hate programming and you're here because you have to?
- Rants about how you love William and Orlin and are dying to learn how to code from them (we know you want to say this)?
